# Hangman challenge

## The challenge

The point of this exercise is to see if you can
write a program which, using `input.txt`,
will produce output identical to `expected_output.txt`.
You can test your work by modifying the executable file called `hangman` and
then running `./completeness_test`.

When you write your code, don't worry if the code is "good" or if it adheres to object-oriented programming principles.
All that matters is if it passes the `completeness_test`.

## How to submit your solution

If you're interested in having me refactor your solution to be more object-oriented (plus any other improvements that I see can be made), do the following:

1. Clone this repo (or fork it if you know how)
2. Complete the solution using the instructions above
3. Send an email to jason@codewithjason.com with a link to your solution

After you send me your code, and provided that your solution works and I have enough time, I'll send you back my refactored version.

## Important note

Part of the reason I'm willing to do this is so that I can have some "before" and "after" code examples for my books and blog posts. By submitting your solution, you give me permission to use your code in my materials.

Thanks in advance for participating.
